# The Rational Expectations Random Utility Maximization (RERUM) Model
### Modeling location choice in a multispecies catch-share fishery
***
### Purpose
This project develops a model of spatiotemporal fishing behavior that incorporates the dynamic and general equilibrium elements of catch-share fisheries. We construct an estimation strategy that is able to recover structural behavioral parameters through a nested fixed-point maximum likelihood procedure. The modeling approach is illustrated through a Monte Carlo analysis. We demonstrate its importance for predicting out-of-sample counterfactual policies.
