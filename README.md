### Modeling fishery choice in a multispecies catch share fishery
***
### Purpose
To predict the behavior of a multispecies commercial fleet in response to regulatory changes, such as reducing harvest limits on bycatch species.  This project develops an empirical modeling approach that can be used to evaluate alternative policies, examine the tradeoffs between bycatch limit reductions and foregone industry profits, and identify species and populations that may be at increased risk from industry behavior changes. The methodological approach is capable of being applied to generally to multispecies fisheries that are managed by catch shares.
